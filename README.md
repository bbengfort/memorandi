**A simple thought recording tool for personal use.**

[![The Inner Chapters][butterfly_dream.jpg]][butterfly_dream.jpg]

This simple project is intended to be a personal recording tool to capture
private snippets from my own inner chapters. I've started and failed at
doing this before (paper journals, blogs, etc). It is my hope that some
small web application that performs automatic data extraction (where I am,
what the weather is, etc.) will enable me to maintain my habit. Because
the server is RESTful, I'm hoping that I can use it from any number of
apps as well. I probably will also include email reminders.

I'd like the memories and thoughts that I have in my daily life to be
available to my daughter. I'm a data scientist, I'll create the data for
her! (Also, this project is hugely procrastinating...)
